# <span style="color:yellow">Trees!</span>

Trees are a programming data structure where data is connected via pointers (things that point to what data is next). Trees excel in storing and retrieving data. Its performance can range from O(n) to a fast O(log n) depending on its implementation...

There are many different types of tree data structures. We will be going over a couple kinds of binary trees.

# <span style="color:yellow">Binary Trees and Their Parts</span>

This is a diagram of the basic parts of a binary tree, most of its parts are similar or the same as other kinds of trees.

![Diagram of a basic tree](images/tree_diagram.jpg)

Node - Each bubble represents a node. A node is a space where data is stored. Binary trees have no more than two nodes beneath another.

#1- Root: The root of a tree is its starting node. Everything else in the tree flows from its root.

#2- Parent: A parent node is a node that has connected nodes below it. (#1 and #3 are also parent nodes)

#3- Child: A child node is a node that is below another (a parent) node. (All nodes except the root node is a child node.)

#6- Leaf: A leaf is a node with no connecting nodes. (#4 and #5 are also leaves of the example tree)

Subtree- A subtree is a tree within a tree. In the example, the nodes of #2, #4, and #5 form a subtree. A subtree is formed by any nodes below another.

#

# <span style="color:yellow">Binary Search Trees</span>

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree that sorts its data when data is stored in it. It does so by comparing the new data to to data already stored within the tree. If the new data is greater than the data within the parent (root if it is the beginning) node, then the new data will be stored to the right of it or be compared to the data in the parent node of that subtree. </br>
If the new data had been less than the parent node, the data would then be stored on the left side or compared to the parent node of that subtree.

Look at the example tree below. See that it now has data stored in its nodes. </br>
![BST sorting example](images/binary_tree_sorting_example.jpg)

Following the rule of sorting given above if we wanted to add 11 to the list where would it go?

-First, we would check the root node. Since 11 is greater than 10, we then look to the root's right child node.

-11 is then compared to 12. Because 11 is less than 12, we go to the left of the 12 node.

-Because there is no node saved as a left child node of 12, 11 is stored there. </br>
![BST sorting example](images/binary_tree_sorting_example_11.jpg)

Let's look at the original tree again. Where would we add 7 in the original tree?

![BST sorting example](images/binary_tree_sorting_example.jpg)

<details>
  <summary><span style="color:orange">Answer</span></summary>
 We will add 7 as the right child node of 5.

![BST sorting example 2](images/binary_tree_sorting_example_7.jpg)

</details>

Because of how these trees are organized and have their data stored, binary BSTs are very fast to sort through! Each time we compare the given value to the stored value, we are able to cut out half of the remaining values in the tree.

Look at the example below as we look for the stored value of 9.

![BST finding example](images/binary_tree_finding_example_.jpg)

As we test the desired value against the stored value, we are able to rule out other sections (subtrees) of the tree. This ruling out makes searching through a tree much faster than searching through other data structures, like a list, where you have to look at each piece of data until you find it. Generally, searching a BST happens in O(log n) time due to the ability to cut out part of the values stored in the tree.

What if the BST looks a little different? Maybe something like the one below.

![BST finding example](images/bst_bad_example.jpg)

Each of the nodes are linked in a row. It looks more like a list or a linked list than a tree. And because it looks like a list it is going to perform the same as one. Because this tree has no offshoots on the left, there is not way to cut any data out and we are forced to check each value until we find the one we want. This is what we call an <span style="color:orange">unbalanced</span> tree, meaning that one side contains more than a few nodes more than the other.

#

# <span style="color:yellow">Balanced Binary Search Trees</span>

A balanced binary search tree (balanced BST) is the solution to this issue of unbalance. A balanced BST is a BST that does not have a great height discrepancy between any of its subtrees.

The height of a tree is the number of nodes from the root to the leaves of the tree. See the example below.

![Balanced BST height example](images/tree_height_example.jpg)

The total height of the tree above is 4 because that is the greatest height counted. This tree is also still balanced because there is not a great discrepancy between the number of nodes in a subtree. The difference in height is only 1. If we were to add 18 as a child node of 16, the tree would be unbalanced.

<span style="color:yellow">How do we balance a BST?</span>

Because the data we use and store can lead us to have an unbalanced tree, we need a way to re-balance it. There are many ways of doing this, from manually moving the nodes around, to using algorithms to sort the list into a balanced state. A couple of examples of these algorithms are red-black trees, AA trees, and AVL trees.

These algorithms detect if a tree is unbalanced and rearrange the nodes in order to end up with a balanced tree. Doing so allows us to take full advantage of a tree's ability to sort through data quickly.

While incredibly useful, the functionality of these algorithms is outside the scope of this tutorial.

# <span style="color:yellow">Operations of a BST</span>

Out of the data structures we've gone over, BSTs are the most complicated. The operations of a BST and balanced BST are much different than the other data structures as well and take more time to go over. Because of this, we will only be going over the operations of inserting and traversing.

Before going over these operations, we need to go over a concept called recursion as both operations use it.

#

<span style="color:yellow">Recursion</span>

#

Put simply, recursion is a function calling itself. You can think of it kind of like a loop. See an example of a recursive function below.

```python
def annoying_song():
    print("This is the song that never ends Yes, it goes on and on, my friends Some people started singing it not knowing what it was And theyâ€²ll continue singing it forever just because")

    annoying_song()
```

While this is a silly example it does show recursion. Each time the function is called, it prints off text and calls the function again. Unfortunately, because of the way the function is written, the program may actually seem to do what the song says and never end because we didn't place any restrictions on it or anything to stop it.

Fortunately there is a safeguard against this infinite number of calls. If we were to call the above function, we would get an error. This is what VS Code will tell us if we run it.

![RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object](images/recursion_error.png)

There is a maximum recursion depth built in to stop the program. It needs to happen because too many functions get caught on the call stack. The call stack is stack data structure that we've gone over, that basically keeps track of what function the program is on. These calls build up because if you look at our function, the first call to it never actually ends. Before the first call can end, the next call has to end. Before the second call can end, the third has to end, and so on.
This building up can be seen in the call stack below

![Call stack](images/call_stack.png)

To help stop our program from running into a recursion error, we can follow two important rules.

#1- Break your problem up into a smaller problem. This smaller problem will be easier to solve when broken down.

#2- Create a base case. A base case is a stopping point. It will tell our program at what point it can stop and return a value instead of continuing to call itself.

Lets make another recursion example looking at factorials. Factorials are a great example of a great use of recursion. Before we write our code, lets start by applying the recursion rules we laid out.

Applying rule #1:
How can we break the problem up into smaller ones? What are we trying to solve, and how would it be helpful to use recursion?

Well, let's think about factorials. A factorial is a number times all the numbers beneath it. (We're going to focus on positive integer factorials) For example

5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1

so if we were then ask a program to solve 5!, what could we do. Well, we could say that 5! = 5 x (5 - 1)!. In English, this says 5 factorial is equal to 5 times the factorial of the number below 5. We could re-write that equation as i! = i x (i - 1)! to solve for any factorial.

Now that we broke our problem up, we need to create a base case for our program to know when to stop calling itself. What is the end of the factorial number line (the numbers the factorial needs to be multiplied by)? Wo we know what the value of that number will be? Yes, we know it! 1 is the last number our factorial needs to be multiplied by, and we know that 1! = 1. This creates an excellent base case for our function, where we can tell it to stop when it gets to 1! and return 1 instead.
Look at the example below

```python
def factorials(i):
    if n <= 1:   # This if statement is our base case, which we check for first
        return 1 # If our basecase it hit, we return 1

    else:        # If we don't hit our base case, we will call our function again
        return i * factorials(i-1) # We subtract 1 from our current number
```

In effect, for 5!, the call stack with what our functions are doing and actual values plugged in might look something like this,

-Top-

return 1

return 2 \* 1!

return 3 \* 2!

return 4 \* 3!

return 5 \* 4! (this is the original call of the function)

-Bottom-

#

<span style="color:yellow">Operations</span>

Some common BST operations include

#1- insert(value): Inserting into a tree requires the use of recursion to look for the proper place for
our data. As we will use recursion, we will also follow the rules of recursion that we set up.
The smaller problem we will be solving is to determine which side we will store the value on depending on the value. Our base case would be whenever we get to a leaf of the tree (an empty space) where we can store the value.

Doing the actual insertion is also different than the other data structures we've gone over. This is because BSTs are not build into Python, so we will be using a BST class to implement one. Because the BST is a class, each node is its own object.

The way that inserting into a BST is different than other things we've gone over is similar
to the other operations we will go over.

This is an O(log n) operation.

# <span style="color:yellow">Examples using a BST</span>

### <span style="color:yellow">Example</span>

Lets look at an example of using a BST

We're going to write a function to find the sum of the data in
the BST.

As we're going to use recursion we're going to model our function after some of the other recursive functions. We'll use two functions like many of the other functions do.

However, first, lets apply our two rules of recursion. What is the smaller problem we're trying to solve? How can we break our bigger problem down?
Our basic problem is simply adding the data from an individual node to the total sum.

Now what can be a base case for us? At what point should we stop recursion? We will want to stop after we get to a leaf on the tree.

Lets start by writing a function to work as a base case.

```python
def sum_numbers(self):
	#if the root does not exist, we will return 0 as the tree
	#contains no data.
	if self.root == None:
		return 0
	#call the recursive function that will add each piece of
	#data to the total sum.
	else:
		return self.sum_numbers_(self.root)
```

Now lets create the function that will do the adding!

```python
def sum_numbers_(self, node)

#Create a value to contain the sum
sum = 0
sum += node.data
```

Next, we need the part of our function that will continue
going to the next nodes

```python
	#if the node to the right is not none, we will recursively call the function again and use the right node
	if node.right is not None:
		sum += self.sum_numbers_(node.right)

	#if the node to the left is not none, we will recursively call the function again and use the left node
	if node.left is not None:
		sum += self.sum_numbers_(node.left)

	#return the sum. When the callstack gets back to first call
	#the sum will be the total sum of the tree
	return sum
```

When run with the rest of the BST class and the following input, the function will return the following

```python
print("\n=========== Node Height Tests ===========")
tree = BST()
tree.insert(5)
tree.insert(3)
tree.insert(7)
tree.insert(6)
tree.insert(4)
tree.insert(8)

print(tree.sum_numbers()) #33

print("Test 2")

tree1 = BST()
tree1.insert(10)
tree1.insert(4)
tree1.insert(18)
tree1.insert(5)
tree1.insert(11)
tree1.insert(19)

print(tree1.sum_numbers()) #67
```

[See the entire code for the sum_of_tree function](code_examples/sum%20_of_tree.py)

#

## <span style="color:yellow">Now You Try!</span>

Your task is to write a recursive function that will find the height of a given node (given via the data). Here we are defining the height as how far from the root node the node we're looking for is. Because of this, if the node were the root node, the returned height would be 0. If the desired node was a child of the root, the height would be 1, and a child of that would be 2 and so on.

Look at how other functions in the BST class are modeled. The contain functions may be particularly helpful.

Use the memoization given to you to store the height throughout each recursive call.

Remember to use the our rules of recursion.
