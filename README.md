### <span style="color:yellow">Objective</span>

This project is educational, and is meant to teach those new to programming about different data structures, specifically stacks, sets, and trees. Functionality, uses, and efficiency are discussed for each data structure. Those being taught will come out with a deeper understanding fundamental data structures, underlying principles, and the Python language.

### <span style="color:yellow">Language</span>

The data structures are taught in python, and as such all sample code and possible solutions are provided in Python.

The lessons are all written in Markdown, which is a markup language meant for documentation.
